# Supervised Machine Learning with Accord.NET
#### An MVC implementation of Supervised Machine Learning using Accord.NET.
The application uses <b>weather parameters</b> put in by the user to return a <b>decision</b> whether or not it's a good idea to play tennis.
The percentage displays the <b>confidence</b> in that decision based on the <b>data set taught to the Naive Bayes.</b>
<i>(Refinement of this prior data set is what makes it 'supervised' learning).</i>
